- There are 3 important steps in pointer:
    - Step 1: Declaring pointer `int *ptr`
    - Step 2: Initializating pointer `ptr = &x`
    - Step 3: Dereferencing pointer `*ptr`
- WHY having pointer?
    - To access various part of computer system.
    - Thatâ€™s why we use C or C++
    - To access `heap` memory

### `HEAP MEMORY ALLOCATION` (decided at run time not compile time)

*** Creating a dynamic memory ***
- The heap memory will grow larger and larger at the run time. 

### `Problem using Pointers`

1. Uninitialized Ptr
2. Memory Leak (int *ptr)
3. Dangling pointer

### `REFERENCE`

- `int x = 10`
- `int &y = x`
- `y` will be `x`
