I/ Review: Pointer and reference
    + Homework and Exercises (Will be assigned)

II/ Topics:
    + More C++ Object-Oriented (3 - 4 weeks)
    + Week 2:   - Templates functions and classes
                - Recursion (more problems)
                -> Including Algorithm and Analysis
		- Asymptotic notation (Time complexity) Chapter 3 of the Shaffer text
		- Linked List
		- Stacks
		- Queues
		- Dictionaries (chapter 4 of the Shaffer textbook)
		
* Recursion: 
    Example 1 Fib
    - f_0 = 1, f_1 = 1;
    if n > 1; f_n = f_(n-1) + f_(n-2)
    Example 2: Factorial
    - f_0 = 1, f_1 = 1;
    - if n > 1, f_n = n * fact(n-1)
    Example 3:
    Memoization => To store prior computed values to be used later
        Ex: array[10] = . . . . . . . . . .
        - When computing an f_i for the first time, update the array.

    * Recursive with more than 1 argument
        - Indirectly Recursive (Practice this)
	
* Asymptotic notation: Run time of the algorithm
* Templates: Passing data type as a parameter so that we can use various of data type for a function


*** MATH 173 WEEK 2 - DAY 1 ***
* Note: All code needs to be annotated
    - Chapter 4, 5: Control statements (Looping control, if-else, if else-if)
    - Chapter 6: functions
    - Chapter 3: Classes

** Homework should include:
1. Display data on console.
2. Do computation, like calculator.


* Notes:
1. Cover string with spaces
2. #include<iomanip>
Setw(5) built-in function => Set the number of character to be displayed.
   (Right indent of 5 characters)
3.
